Switch between visiting buffers (from files) trying to not mess up things.

== RATIONAL ==
Maybe not.

Functions, bars and hooks to switch between buffers visiting files,
avoiding the shocking reordering made by the default buffer-mode.
If you are visiting file foo.txt and then open file bar.txt, the latter
will stays next to the former until you kill them, no matter what!

Setting some appropriate key bindings, you can choose, time to time,
to switch buffers in the orrib...traditional way or with this...thing.
